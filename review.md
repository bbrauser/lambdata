# Review


  1- The code format is great, very readable and clean. Both the functions and classes have clear little messages.

  2- Functions are clear, and I think it is clever to show the results in dataframes for your first 2 functions, makes it look good

  3- Functions seem great, I'd really would have to be nitpicking to find a suggestion or constructive criticism.
   I would only recommend giving instructions? just to point out the obvious of how to use the functions in real
    life. You might also want to add a function to return the residue of a division. I am pretty sure that divisor
    will only return whole numbers
